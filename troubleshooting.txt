# SPOTIFY

403 Player Put

- What
    - Randomly began to disallow playback transfer to client.
- Fix
    - I restarted all spotify instances and closed all client instances. Opened desktop client and confirmed I could play music.
- Why
    - I think there is a playback session that must have been misconfigured on Spotifyâ€™s server side. I was listening to Spotify on my mobile in the morning. I was also using the platform on Quest last night.
